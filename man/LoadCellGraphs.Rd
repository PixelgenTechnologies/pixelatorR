\item{...}{Parameters passed to other methods}

\item{cells}{A character vector of cell names to load CellGraphs for}

\item{load_as}{Choose how the cell graph should be represented (see details below)}

\item{add_marker_counts}{Should marker counts be added to the CellGraph objects?}

\item{chunk_size}{Length of chunks used to load CellGraphs from edge list.}

\item{force}{Force load graph(s) if they are already loaded}

\item{cl}{A cluster object created by makeCluster, or an integer
to indicate number of child-processes (integer values are ignored
on Windows) for parallel evaluations. See Details on performance
in the documentation for \code{pbapply}. The default is NULL,

\value{
An object with a list of \code{\link{CellGraph}} objects
}
\description{
Loads a list of \code{\link{CellGraph}} objects. One can specify cells to load by
their names using the \code{cells} parameter.
}
\details{
Graphs can be loaded as one of 'bipartite', 'Anode' or 'linegraph'. See details about each of
these graph representations in the sections below.

\section{Bi-partite graph}{

In the bi-partite graph, edges can only go from a upia to a upib. The bi-partite graph
is first collapsed from a multigraph to a simple graph by aggregating marker counts
for each upia/upib combination. For visualization of marker counts on the graph, it is
often convenient to project values on the nodes; however, the marker counts are not available
in the nodes in the bi-partite graph. To circumvent this issue, node counts are calculated
by aggregating its edge counts. This means that the total marker count will be inflated.
}

\section{A node projected-graph}{

In the A node projected-graph, pairs of upias that share a upib are connected with an edge.
The (upia) node counts are calculated by aggregating counts across all edges associated
with the A nodes. The number of nodes in the A node projected-graph is substantially
lower than the bi-partite graph.
}

\section{Line graph}{

Starting with a bi-partite graph, a node is placed on each edge. Then, an edge is drawn
between each pair of adjacent nodes. The number of nodes in the linegraph is equivalent
to the number of edges in the bi-partite graph. However, the number of edges is substantially
larger. One major advantage with the linegraph is that the node counts represent the actual
raw data, which is not the case for the bi-partite graph and the A node projected-graph. On the
down side, linegraphs are much larger and tends to slow down layout computations and
visualizations.
