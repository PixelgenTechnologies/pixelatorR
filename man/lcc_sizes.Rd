\title{Calculate the sizes of the LCCs from an edgelist}
\usage{
lcc_sizes(df, mc_cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble with columns \code{pq_files} (paths to parquet files) and \code{fracs}
generated with \code{\link{downsample_to_parquet}}.}

\item{mc_cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the sizes of the largest connected components (LCC) for each
fraction in \code{df$fracs}. The results are grouped by cell (component).
}
\description{
This function calculates the sizes of the largest connected components (LCCs)
from a set of parquet files containing downsampled edgelists. The LCCs are
computed for each fraction specified in the input tibble \code{df}, linking each
fraction to its corresponding parquet file. Moreover, the LCCs are computed per
cell (component).
