)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_lazy} object with proximity scores.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Currently not used.}

\item{background_threshold_pct}{The background abundance level given as a fraction
total UMI counts. For example, 0.05 means that the background is set at 5\% of the
total UMI counts for each cell. A protein pair must have at least this fraction
for both proteins to be kept in the table.}

\item{background_threshold_count}{The background abundance level given as a UMI count.
For example, 30 means that the background is set at 30 UMI counts. A protein pair
must have at least this UMI count for both proteins to be kept in the table. Note that
this puts a hard cutoff on the UMI counts, which may not be desired if the cells have
very different total UMI counts.}

\item{min_cells_count}{The minimum number of cells in which a protein pair must be
detected to be kept in the table. This is useful to remove protein pairs that are
detected in very few cells, which may be due to noise or low expression levels.}

\item{name}{Name of the temporary table in the database containing the filtered proximity scores.}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_lazy} with filtered proximity scores.
}
\description{
At least one of the thresholds must be set. The function will filter out protein
pairs that do not meet the specified thresholds.

All filters can be used together or separately, but it's  recommended to only use
the \code{background_threshold_pct} filter. This filter is applied to the fraction
of UMI counts which does not depend on the cell size (total number of molecules).

The filters are applied in the following order:
\enumerate{
\item Remove protein pairs with a minimum UMI count fraction below \code{background_threshold_pct}
\item Remove protein pairs with a minimum UMI count below \code{background_threshold_count}
\item Remove protein pairs detected in fewer than \code{min_cells_count} cells
}
