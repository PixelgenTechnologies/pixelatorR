\title{Clean up Unlinked Edgelist Directories}
\usage{
clean_edgelists_directories()
}
\description{
Each time a \code{Seurat} with a \code{CellGraphAssay} or a \code{CellGraphAssay} is created,
renamed, filtered (by cells) or merged, a copy of the associated edgelist is made
in the \code{getOption("pixelatorR.arrow_outdir")} directory. For large data sets,
these edgelist files can use up several gigabytes of disk space. This function
scans through the \code{getOption("pixelatorR.arrow_outdir")} directory and removes
any edgelist files that are not linked to \code{Seurat} objects or \code{CellGraphAssay}s
in the global environment. Note that only global variables which inherits the \code{Seurat}
or \code{CellGraphAssay} class are considered, as well as lists containing these object types.
