\description{
This function computes an approximate saturation curve for nodes and edges
in an edgelist. The edgelist is downsampled to various fractions of the
total number of reads, and the number of remaining nodes and edges are calculated
for each fraction. The saturation values are then calculated relative to the
theoretical maximum number of nodes and edges using the Chao1 estimator. The
theoretical maximum is computed for each component in the full edgelist. Note
that Chao1 will give a lower bound for the theoretical maximum, hence the
saturation values are likely overestimated. The estimate will be more robust
if the sample was sequenced at a high depth.
