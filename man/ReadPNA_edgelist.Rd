\title{Load the edge list from a PNA PXL file}
\usage{
ReadPNA_edgelist(
  pxl_file,
  cells = NULL,
  umi_data_type = c("int64", "string", "suffixed_string"),
  lazy = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pxl_file}{Path to a PXL file with a PNA data set}

\item{cells}{A character vector with component IDs. If NULL, all components are loaded.}

\item{umi_data_type}{One of "int64", "string" or "suffixed_string". Default is "int64".
\itemize{
\item "int64": The UMIs are encoded as int64
\item "string": The UMIs are encoded as character
\item "suffixed_string": The UMIs are encoded as character with a suffix '-umi1' or '-umi2' added
}}

\item{lazy}{A logical specifying whether to load the data lazily. If \code{TRUE},
a \code{tbl_lazy} object is returned.}
}
\description{
Note that the umi1 and umi2 sequences are encoded as \code{integer64} which
is not natively supported by R. The \code{bit64} package is required to
read these IDs and conversion to \code{integer} or \code{numeric} should
be avoided. It is safer to convert these to character vectors if needed
for downstream processing.
