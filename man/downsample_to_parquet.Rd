\title{Filter an edgelist by downsampling read counts}
\usage{
downsample_to_parquet(pxl_file, outdir, components, fracs = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1))
}
\arguments{
\item{pxl_file}{Path to the PXL file.}

\item{outdir}{Directory to write the output parquet files.}

\item{components}{A character vector of component names to keep.}

\item{fracs}{A numeric vector of fractions to downsample by.}
}
\value{
A tibble with paths to the written parquet files and the fractions.
}
\description{
Filter an edgelist (for a subset of components) in a PXL file by
downsampling read counts using predefined fractions. The probability
of a read staying in the edgelist is \eqn{1 - (1 - frac) ^ read_count}.
}
\details{
The filtered edgelist(s) are written to parquet files in \code{outdir}.
