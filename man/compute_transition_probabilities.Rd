\usage{
compute_transition_probabilities(A, k = 1, remove_self_loops = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{An adjacency matrix}

\item{k}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}} An integer value specifying the
distance from each node where additional edges are added to expand the neighborhood from each node. E.g.
with \code{k = 2}, each node will additionally be connected with all neighbors
of the nodes their original neighborhood. With \code{k = 1} (default), only
the adjacent neighbors will be used.}

\item{remove_self_loops}{Whether to remove self-loops from the transition probability matrix.}
}
\value{
A matrix of transition probabilities. The transition probability \eqn{P^k(u \rightarrow v)}
for a k-step walk is found in row \eqn{u} and column \eqn{v} of the transition probability matrix.
Row \eqn{v} and column \eqn{u} gives the reversed transition probability \eqn{P^k(v \rightarrow u)}
for the k-step walk.
}
\description{
Create a transition probability matrix from an adjacency matrix.

library(igraph)
g <- make_lattice(c(2, 3))
A <- as_adjacency_matrix(g)
