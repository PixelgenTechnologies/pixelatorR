\usage{
color_by_marker(
  cg,
  markers,
  smooth_counts = TRUE,
  palette = "viridis",
  rev_pal = FALSE,
  mode = c("product", "sum"),
  normalize = TRUE,
  trim_quantiles = c(0, 1),
  nNodes = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cg}{A \code{\link{CellGraph}} object}

\item{markers}{A character vector with valid marker IDs}

\item{smooth_counts}{Applies neighborhood smoothing of marker counts.
Each node marker counts is combined with the sum of marker counts in
a neighborhood of length 1.}

\item{palette}{A valid color palette from \code{RColorBrewer} or \code{viridis}
or a vector of colors.}

\item{rev_pal}{Should the palette be reversed?}

\item{mode}{Only used if more than 1 marker is provided. With \code{mode = "product"},
the marker counts are multiplied and with \code{mode = "sum"}, the marker counts are
summed. This step is executed after smoothing.}

\item{normalize}{Apply normalization to the marker counts after smoothing and
the multiplication/summation step. The values are first divided by the node degree
followed by log-transformation with \code{log1p}.}

\item{trim_quantiles}{A numeric vector of length 2 specifying quantiles to trim.
This can be useful to reduce the influence of outliers. The specified quantiles
are calculated from the marker counts values prior to normalization. (see section below for details)}

\item{nNodes}{Number of nodes to keep in the graph}
}
\description{
Adds node colors based on the expression of a single or multiple
markers. If multiple markers are provided, their values are either
multiplied or summed depending on the \code{mode}.
}
\section{Trim quantile}{

Sometimes, a few outliers can dominate which makes the colors difficult to interpret.
With \code{trim_quantiles}, we can remove such outliers. By setting the upper bound to
0.99, we are calculating the 99th quantile of the marker count values and any values
above this threshold are replaced with the value for the 99th quantile. The same
thing applies to the lower bound but the other way around.
