}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Path to a PXL file}

\item{cells}{A character vector with component IDs. If NULL, all components are loaded.}

\item{graph_projection}{The graph projection to load. Default is 'bipartite'. If multiple
projections are present in the file, only the selected one is loaded.}

\item{verbose}{Print messages}
}

A list of lists with the pre-computed layouts. At the top level, the list is split by

Layouts can be pre-computed with the Pixelator data processing pipeline and
are stored in a hive-styled partitioning in the PXL file. This function reads
the pre-computed layouts from the PXL file and returns them as a list. Use
\code{\link{inspect_pxl_file}} to check the contents of a PXL file.
