\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{Seurat} object}

\item{group_by}{A string specifying the metadata column to group by}

\item{host_population}{A string specifying the host population name
present in the \code{group_by} column}

\item{target_population}{A string specifying the target population name
present in the \code{group_by} column}

\item{abundance_difference}{A numeric value specifying how many times
higher the abundance of a marker should be in one population relative
to the other. This is only used to label the markers in the output.}

\item{min_freq}{A numeric value specifying the minimum frequency of
a protein to be labeled in the output table.}

\item{show_plot}{Logical, whether to show a plot summarizing the results.}

\item{seed}{An integer seed for reproducibility}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_df} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{marker}: the name of the protein.
\item \code{host_unmixed_freq}: the estimated proportion in the host population after unmixing.
\item \code{target_unmixed_freq}: the estimated proportion in the target population after unmixing.
\item \code{host_freq}: the proportion in the host population.
\item \code{target_freq}: the proportion in the target population.
\item \code{label}: a label indicating whether the protein is a marker for the host
or target population. NA values indicate that the protein is unspecific.

\description{
Patch detection can be applied to identify patches of one cell type
on another. The prerequisite for this analysis is that the patch-specific
markers are known. Patch detection can be improved further by also leveraging
host-specific markers. This function identifies population-specific markers
for the patch and host populations, which can then be used for patch detection.
}
\details{
Patch detection is sensitive to the selection of markers and therefore requires
careful selection. The best markers are both high-abundant and specific to a
cell population.

The method requires a \code{Seurat} object with a metadata column containing
the population information, e.g. a column with cell type labels. We then need
to specify the host and target populations, where the host population represent
the cells on which the patches are expected to be found and the target population
represents the cell type from which the patches originated.

As a practical example, let's say that our data represent co-cultured T and B cells,
and we anticipate that the T cells have patches of B cells on them. Now we face a
challenge because the T cell population contains a lot of B cell markers, making it
harder to determine what markers are T-cell specific. In other words, the abundance
data is mixed.

This method attempts to unmix the abundance data using matrix factorization, estimating
the composition of the pure host and target populations. The unmixed abundance profiles
are then used to label population-specific markers based on the difference in abundance
and minimum frequency. The results are summarized in a table, and an optional plot is drawn
to help interpret the results.
