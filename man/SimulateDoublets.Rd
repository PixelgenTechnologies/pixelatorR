\usage{
SimulateDoublets(
  count_data,
  ref_cells1 = NULL,
  ref_cells2 = NULL,
  n_sim = 1000,
  seed = 37,
  method = c("average", "sum"),
  simulated_cell_prefix = "simcell_"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_data}{A count matrix. Rows are features, and columns are cells.}

\item{ref_cells1, ref_cells2}{A character vector with cell names or indices to use as the first and second reference
populations. If NULL, all cells are used.}

\item{n_sim}{An integer with the number of doublets to simulate.}

\item{seed}{An integer with the seed for the random number generator.}

\item{method}{A character with the method to use to simulate doublets. Options are "average" (average of the two
cells) or "sum" (sum of the two cells).}

\item{simulated_cell_prefix}{A character with the prefix to use for the simulated doublet cell names.}
}
\value{
A matrix with simulated doublets. Rows are features, and columns are simulated doublets.
}
\description{
Simulates doublets by summing pairs of randomly selected cells from a matrix.
}
\examples{
dat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 10)
SimulateDoublets(dat, n_sim = 1000)
